Hi George,

Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns about the weather during your recent stay with us. I'm so sorry to hear that it was cloudy and overcast, and I can understand why you'd want to write a song about it!

Regarding your question about the weather in Arizona in April, I've checked the records and it seems that April is usually a great time to visit Arizona, with temperatures often reaching highs of around 100째F (38째C) and lows of around 60째F (16째C). However, it's not uncommon to have some cloudy days during this time.

I want to assure you that we value your feedback and take all concerns seriously. We're always looking for ways to improve our services, including providing the best possible experience for our guests. Although we can't control the weather, we'll do our best to ensure that our facilities and services meet your expectations.

Thank you again for your email, and I hope you'll give us another chance to show you a sunny Arizona experience in the future.

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
