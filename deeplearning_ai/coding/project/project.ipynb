    "Finally, move your agent to the cloud! Instead of running code locally, execute everything in an E2B sandbox—a secure, isolated environment perfect for untrusted code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🎯 **Goal:** Integrate E2B sandbox with your coding agent for safe cloud execution\n",
    "- 🔁 **Workflow:** Create sandbox, modify execute_code to use sandbox, update agent to pass sandbox to tools\n",
    "- 💡 **Remember:** Sandboxes are persistent—you can reconnect, query by metadata, and serve websites from them\n",

    "## 🔍 E2B Sandbox Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolated execution** - Code runs in secure microVM\n",
    "2. **File system** - Create, read, write, delete files\n",
    "3. **Multiple languages** - Python, JavaScript, Bash\n",
    "4. **Web hosting** - Serve applications on custom ports\n",
    "5. **Persistent** - Reconnect to existing sandboxes by ID\n",

    "## 🧱 Sandbox Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create Sandbox:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sbx = Sandbox.create(timeout=60 * 60)  # 1 hour\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execute Code:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "execution = sbx.run_code(\"print('Hello')\")\n",
    "result = execution.to_json()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modified Agent:**\n",
    "- Pass `sbx` parameter to agent function\n",
    "- Update execute_code to use `sbx.run_code()`\n",
    "- Handle execution results and metadata (images, charts)\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Test with a simple task first, then try complex multi-step projects\n",

    "\n",
    "Context: See attached spec.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. Import display and Image from IPython.display, and import base64\n",
    "2. Modify execute_code function to accept sbx: Sandbox parameter\n",
    "3. Replace exec() with sbx.run_code(code) and capture execution object\n",
    "4. Handle execution.results and execution.error\n",
    "5. For results with PNG data, store in metadata dict and set result.png = None\n",
    "6. Return execution.to_json() and metadata dict as tuple\n",
    "7. Define execute_code_schema (same as before, LLM doesn't know about sbx parameter)\n",
    "8. Update execute_tool to pass sbx=sbx kwarg to tools\n",
    "9. Update coding_agent to accept sbx parameter and pass it to execute_tool\n",
    "10. Create test: sbx = Sandbox.create(timeout=3600), run agent with query \"Generate 50 random numbers and plot histogram\"\n",
    "11. After agent completes, decode and display images: for each png_data in metadata[\"images\"], use display(Image(data=base64.b64decode(png_data))) to convert the base64 string from E2B to binary data for IPython\n",
