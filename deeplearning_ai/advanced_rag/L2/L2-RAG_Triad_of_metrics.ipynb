While the \\nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — \\nand coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these \\nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \\nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s \\ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations.  In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy?  Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences.  Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them.

apply in a wide \\nrange of professions, but AI \\ninvolves unique elements.\\n For example:Three Steps to Career Growth\\nAI is nascent, and many technologies are still evolving.  While the \\nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing — \\nand coursework is an efficient way to master them — beyond these \\nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \\nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project’s \\ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations.  In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy?  Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences.  Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them.
